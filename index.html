    <h1>FC Barcelona</h1>
    <p>
      Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English
      footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan
      culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a
      club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate
      Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth
      $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue,
      with an annual turnover of €840.8 million. The official Barcelona anthem
      is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.
      Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and red stripes,
      leading to the nickname Blaugrana.

      Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa
      del Rey, thirteen Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa
      de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four
      competitions. In international club football, the club has won twenty
      European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record
      four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record
      three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona
      was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History &
      Statistics Club World Ranking for 1992, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015 and as
      of 2021, occupies the fourth position on the UEFA club rankings. The club
      has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two
      teams are referred to as El Clásico.
